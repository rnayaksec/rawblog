Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. Here's how you can perform a basic Diffie-Hellman key exchange using OpenSSL on Linux:

### Step-by-Step Demo

1. **Generate Diffie-Hellman Parameters**:
   

```bash
openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048
```

2. **Generate Private Keys for Both Parties**:
* **For Party A**:

```sh
openssl genpkey -paramfile dhparam.pem -out privateA.pem
```

* **For Party B**:

```sh
openssl genpkey -paramfile dhparam.pem -out privateB.pem
```

1. **Extract Public Keys from the Private Keys**:
* **For Party A**:

```sh
openssl pkey -in privateA.pem -pubout -out publicA.pem
```

* **For Party B**:
  

```sh
  openssl pkey -in privateB.pem -pubout -out publicB.pem
  ```

1. **Generate the Shared Secret**:
   - **For Party A (using Party B's public key)**:

     

```sh
openssl pkeyutl -derive -inkey privateA.pem -peerkey publicB.pem -out shared_secret_A.bin
```

- **For Party B (using Party A's public key)**:
  

```sh
     openssl pkeyutl -derive -inkey privateB.pem -peerkey publicA.pem -out shared_secret_B.bin
```

2. **Verify the Shared Secrets Match**:
   

```sh
   diff shared_secret_A.bin shared_secret_B.bin && echo "Shared secrets match!" || echo "Shared secrets do not match!"
   ```

### Explanation

* **Step 1**: Generates Diffie-Hellman parameters (a shared foundation) which both parties use.
* **Step 2**: Each party generates their private keys using the shared parameters.
* **Step 3**: Extracts public keys from the private keys to be shared with the other party.
* **Step 4**: Each party generates a shared secret using their private key and the other party's public key.
* **Step 5**: Verifies that both parties have derived the same shared secret.
